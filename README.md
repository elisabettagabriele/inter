Instructions on how to run the local host
1. Download vs code if possible
2. Git clone the repo
3. npm install (in order to get the node modules)
4. npm run build (in order to get the build folder)
5. npm start


**If there is trouble opening the localhost, please do not hesitate to contact me.
In this case, the code can still be reviewed through github
